# Dog-Breed-Identifier
In this project, I used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to build a model for image classification. In particular, the CNN developed for this project will attempt to predict the breed of a dog in a given photo.

# Data
The link of training data for this project is located in the links folder. This dataset contains 133 different breeds of dogs and is already split into train, test, and validation sets. Place the training, testing, and validation datasets in the dogImages folder.
